## Challenges

1. Choices I took to style the buttons
 - I used absolute position in order to make the movement of the color
 - And it took me time to get the color background to flow when the button transist
 - item color or element color as it must be hidden on overflow
 2. On box shaddowing was so difficult to choose a relative positioning as I wanted the color to have different backgroung and shadow. inset color values: I need more to know how to make the shadow outside the box, also.
 3. I remove rotation on button no.3 as it didn't move. I wisha I could have put more on it but my challenge was also time limitation to work in hand with theory to understand more Specifity as all 3 buttons I chose Pseudo-class.
